## Instructions for Running

We simply used the code from https://github.com/durandtibo/wildcat.pytorch.

We recommend setting up the dataset in the PASCAL VOC format, and using an online tool such as Roboflow to extract the XML files from the provided JSON files.

Please follow instructions on the relevant README file to prepare the dataset and run the model.
