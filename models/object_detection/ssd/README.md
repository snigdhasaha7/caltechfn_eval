## Instructions for Running

We simply used the code from https://github.com/lufficc/SSD.

To train the model, first set up directories as the instructions say. Since we provide annotations in COCO format, please follow the COCO setup format. We have provided several files already. Please place them in the appropriate folders as per their DEVELOP_GUIDE.md.
